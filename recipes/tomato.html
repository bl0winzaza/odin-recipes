    <h2> The Best Tomato Sandwich!</h2>
    <p> I first made this sandwich because my dumb neighbor was letting the tomatoes and basil from her summer garden rot on her countertop.</p>
    <p> The outrage I felt witnessing this travesty compelled me to sneak into her home and make myself a delicous tomato toast for lunch.</p>
    <h4> Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> Bread- use whatever toasts best, I like wholegrain sandwich bread</li>
        <li> Mayonaise</li>
        <li> Garlic- fresh, powdered or roasted- use what u got!</li>
        <li> Fresh basil baby!</li>
        <li> Big, sexxy, red and juicy tomatoes (must be in season)</li>

    </ul>
    <h4> Assembly:</h4>
    <ol> 
        <li> Toast the bread until it is very crunchy</li>
        <li> Let the toast dry for a minute or two to avoid sogginess</li>
        <li> Slice your tomato in nice thick slices. You can use a paper towel to dab away excess juice if you're worried about the sandwich being too juciy</li>
        <li> Like all good sandwiches slap a crap ton of mayo on it</li>
        <li> Layer sliced tomatoes</li>
        <li> Top with fresh basil and whatever garlic you are using</li>

    </ol>
